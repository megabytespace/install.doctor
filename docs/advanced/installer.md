Install Doctor leverages a custom, multi-OS capable software package installer written in [ZX](https://github.com/google/zx) to handle the bulk of the provisioning process. When passed an array of software package names, the installer leverages a growing software package map stored in the `software.yml` file found in the root of the Install Doctor repository to intelligently determine which installation method to use. It is optimized to re-provision a system as quickly as possible by determining whether software is already installed and updating outdated software.

## How it Works

The installer follows this process for each software package:

1. **Package Lookup** - The package name is looked up in `software.yml`, which maps over 1,000 software packages to their installation methods across different platforms.
2. **Platform Detection** - The installer detects the current operating system and package manager (e.g., `apt` on Ubuntu, `dnf` on Fedora, `brew` on macOS).
3. **Installer Preference** - Based on the `installerPreference` configuration, the installer selects the best available installation method for the current platform.
4. **Skip Check** - Before installing, the installer checks if the software is already present on the system by looking for its binary (defined in the `_bin` field).
5. **Installation** - If not already installed, the package is installed using the preferred method.
6. **Post-Install** - Any post-installation scripts defined in `_post` or `_post:<installer>` fields are executed.

## Installer Preference Order

Each platform has a defined order of preference for package managers. For example, on Ubuntu:

```
snap > flatpak > whalebrew > apt > brew > go > cargo > npm > pipx > pip > gem > appimage > script > ansible > binary
```

This means the installer will prefer Snap packages over Flatpak, Flatpak over apt, and so on. You can customize this order in the `installerPreference` section of `software.yml`.

## Software Definition Format

Each entry in `software.yml` follows this structure:

```yaml
package-name:
  _name: Display Name
  _short: Brief one-line description
  _desc: Detailed description of the software
  _github: https://github.com/owner/repo
  _bin: binary-name
  _home: https://project-website.com
  _docs: https://docs-url.com
  # Installation methods
  brew: homebrew-formula-name
  apt: apt-package-name
  dnf: dnf-package-name
  pacman: pacman-package-name
  cask: cask-name
  choco: choco-package-name
  snap: snap-name
  flatpak: org.example.App
  cargo: crate-name
  npm: npm-package-name
  pip: pip-package-name
```

## Platform-Specific Variants

Installation methods can be qualified with platform suffixes to handle cases where a package name differs across distributions:

```yaml
example-tool:
  dnf: example-tool          # Default for all dnf-based distros
  dnf:fedora: example-fedora  # Override specifically for Fedora
  brew: example-tool
  brew:darwin: example-mac    # Override specifically for macOS
```

## Conditional Installation

The `_when:<installer>` field allows you to define shell conditions that must be true before installation proceeds:

```yaml
example-app:
  _when:cask: '! test -d "/Applications/Example.app"'
  cask: example-app
```

## Post-Installation Scripts

The `_post` and `_post:<installer>` fields allow running commands after a package is installed:

```yaml
python:
  brew: python
  _post:brew: python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools && python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
