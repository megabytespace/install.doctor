Install Doctor takes a defense-in-depth approach to security by layering multiple protection mechanisms across the provisioned system. This page details the security features that are currently implemented and configured during provisioning.

## Security Tools Overview

| Tool | Category | Platforms | Installed Via |
|---|---|---|---|
| ClamAV | Antivirus | All | apt/dnf/pacman/brew |
| Rkhunter | Rootkit detection | Linux | apt/dnf/pacman |
| fail2ban | Intrusion prevention | Linux | apt/dnf/pacman |
| Little Snitch | Application firewall | macOS | cask |
| OpenSnitch | Application firewall | Linux | Package manager |
| Portmaster | Application firewall | Linux/Windows | Binary download |
| Cloudflare WARP | Encrypted DNS/VPN | All | Package manager |
| Tailscale | Mesh VPN | All | Package manager |

## Antivirus and Malware Detection

### ClamAV

Install Doctor installs and configures [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/), the open-source antivirus engine, across all supported platforms:

| Component | Purpose | Command |
|---|---|---|
| `clamd` | Real-time file scanning daemon | `systemctl status clamav-daemon` |
| `freshclam` | Automatic signature database updates | `systemctl status clamav-freshclam` |
| `clamscan` | On-demand scanning | `clamscan -r ~/Downloads` |

ClamAV is installed via the system package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`) on Linux and via Homebrew on macOS.

### Rootkit Detection

[Rkhunter](http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net/) (Rootkit Hunter) is installed on Linux systems to scan for:

- Known rootkits and backdoors
- Suspicious file permission changes
- Hidden files in common locations
- Suspicious kernel modules

Run a manual scan with:

```bash
sudo rkhunter --check
```

### Intrusion Prevention

[fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/) is installed on Linux systems to monitor log files and automatically ban IP addresses that show malicious signs such as repeated failed authentication attempts.

```bash
# Check fail2ban status
sudo fail2ban-client status

# View banned IPs for the SSH jail
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

## SSH Hardening

Install Doctor applies hardened SSH configurations during provisioning:

| Hardening Measure | Description | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Custom SSH port | Non-standard port to reduce automated scanning | Defined in `.chezmoi.yaml.tmpl` |
| SELinux integration | Registers custom port with SELinux policy | `semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp $PORT` |
| Key-based auth | SSH key generation and import | Handled during provisioning |
| Service management | Auto-enable SSH service per distribution | `ssh` (Debian/Ubuntu), `sshd` (Fedora/Arch) |

SSH service names vary by distribution:

| Distribution | Service Name | Enable Command |
|---|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `ssh` | `sudo systemctl enable --now ssh` |
| Fedora / CentOS / Arch | `sshd` | `sudo systemctl enable --now sshd` |

## GPG Key Management

Install Doctor configures GPG with security-hardened settings:

- Downloads a hardened `gpg.conf` configuration
- Imports and trusts your GPG key (specified via the `KEYID` environment variable)
- Configures `gpg-agent` with sensible defaults
- Sets appropriate file permissions on `~/.gnupg` (700 for directory, 600 for files)

## Secrets Management

All sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords) is encrypted at rest using [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption and decrypted during provisioning via Chezmoi's built-in decryption support. See the [Secrets documentation](/docs/customization/secrets) for details.

## Application Firewalls

| Firewall | Platform | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/) | macOS | Alerts when apps make network connections; rule-based filtering | Fully integrated |
| [OpenSnitch](https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch) | Linux | Application-level firewall inspired by Little Snitch | Package defined |
| [Portmaster](https://safing.io/portmaster/) | Linux/Windows | Privacy-focused firewall with built-in DNS filtering | Package defined |

## Network Security

| Tool | Purpose | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) | Encrypted DNS and optional VPN tunneling | `CLOUDFLARE_TEAMS_*` variables |
| [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) | Zero-config WireGuard mesh VPN | `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` |
| [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) | Modern VPN protocol | NetworkManager profiles in `~/.config/vpn/` |
| [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) | Traditional VPN | `.ovpn` files in `~/.config/vpn/` |

## Security Philosophy

Install Doctor's security approach prioritizes:

1. **Layered defense** - No single point of failure. Multiple tools cover different threat vectors.
2. **Sensible defaults** - Security features are enabled by default without requiring user configuration.
3. **Non-intrusive** - Security tools run in the background and do not interfere with normal workflow.
4. **Cross-platform consistency** - The same security posture is applied regardless of the operating system.

## Planned Features

The following security features are defined in the software catalog but not yet fully integrated into the provisioning pipeline:

- **Firejail** - Application sandboxing for Linux (profiles pending)
- **AppArmor profiles** - Mandatory access control policies for applications
- **Advanced host-based IDS** - Extended intrusion detection beyond fail2ban
