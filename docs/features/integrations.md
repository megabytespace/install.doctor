Install Doctor integrates with a range of third-party services to enhance the provisioned system with monitoring, networking, security, and developer productivity features. This page provides an overview of each integration and how to enable it.

## Integration Philosophy

When selecting third-party services for official support, Install Doctor prioritizes:

1. **Free tiers** - All integrations must offer a meaningful free tier suitable for individual use
2. **Privacy-respecting** - Services must have transparent data handling policies
3. **Cross-platform** - Integrations should work across macOS and Linux at minimum
4. **API-driven** - Services must support automated configuration through APIs or CLI tools
5. **Self-hostable** (preferred) - When possible, self-hosted alternatives are preferred
