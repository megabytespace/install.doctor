After Scripts run once Chezmoi has finished applying dotfiles and configuration files to the system. They handle the bulk of the provisioning work: installing software packages, applying system-level configuration files, configuring services, and cleaning up. All After Scripts are located in `home/.chezmoiscripts/universal/` and use the `run_after_` prefix.

## Script Inventory

| Order | Filename | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `run_after_01-pre-install.sh.tmpl` | Early bootstrapping: runs scripts that can safely execute before the main software installation (e.g., GPG key import, SSH key setup) |
| 10 | `run_after_10-install.sh.tmpl` | **Main software installation**: invokes the ZX-based installer to install all packages for the selected `SOFTWARE_GROUP`. This is the longest-running script |
| 15 | `run_after_15-chezmoi-system.sh.tmpl` | Copies system-level config files from `~/.config/system/` to their target locations on the filesystem (e.g., `/etc/`, `/usr/local/etc/`) |
| 20 | `run_after_20-post-install.sh.tmpl` | Post-install tasks: configures installed services (Tailscale, Netdata, Docker, etc.), sets up integrations, applies macOS `defaults write` settings |
| 24 | `run_after_24-cleanup.sh.tmpl` | Removes temporary files, cleans up dotfiles clutter from the home directory, final housekeeping |

## Execution Order

Scripts run synchronously in filename order. The numbering gaps (01, 10, 15, 20, 24) leave room for adding custom scripts:

```
[Chezmoi applies dotfiles]          → Dotfiles deployed to home directory
run_after_01-pre-install.sh         → Early bootstrapping (GPG, SSH)
run_after_10-install.sh             → Main software installation (longest step)
run_after_15-chezmoi-system.sh      → System config file deployment
run_after_20-post-install.sh        → Service configuration and integrations
run_after_24-cleanup.sh             → Cleanup and final housekeeping
```

## Adding Custom After Scripts

To add your own script that runs between existing steps, create a file with a number between the existing scripts:

```bash
# Example: run_after_12-my-custom-setup.sh.tmpl
# This runs after software installation (10) but before system files (15)
{{- if ne .host.distro.family "windows" -}}
{{ includeTemplate "universal/profile" }}
{{ includeTemplate "universal/logg" }}

gum log -sl info 'Running custom setup...'
# Your custom logic here

{{ end -}}
```

## Provision Completion

After all After Scripts have executed, the Chezmoi-based provisioning process is finished. If you launched via `bash <(curl -sSL https://install.doctor/start)`, the `provision.sh` wrapper performs additional cleanup, prints log file locations, and may trigger a reboot.
