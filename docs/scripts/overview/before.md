title: Before Scripts Overview
description: Read about how Install Doctor incorporates shell scripting languages into the provisioning process by running scripts before the Chezmoi file provisioning process.

Before Scripts run prior to Chezmoi applying dotfiles and configuration files. They prepare the system by installing core dependencies, decrypting secrets, and applying system-level tweaks. All Before Scripts are located in `home/.chezmoiscripts/universal/` and use the `run_before_` prefix.

## Script Inventory

| Order | Filename | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `run_before_01-prepare.sh.tmpl` | Pre-provisioning preparation: disconnects WARP, checks Full Disk Access on macOS, creates secret symlinks, sources temporary includes |
| 02 | `run_before_02-homebrew.sh.tmpl` | Installs Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS) and Homebrew (macOS/Linux). Configures Homebrew environment variables and PATH |
| 03 | `run_before_03-decrypt-age-key.sh.tmpl` | Installs [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption tool and decrypts `home/key.txt.age` so Chezmoi can access encrypted templates |
| 04 | `run_before_04-requirements.sh.tmpl` | Installs system packages required as dependencies by other software. Package lists are defined per-distro in `home/.chezmoitemplates/` |
| 05 | `run_before_05-system.sh.tmpl` | Applies system tweaks: sets hostname, configures timezone, creates user/group, sets file permissions on `~/.gnupg` |

## Execution Order

Scripts run synchronously in filename order. The two-digit number after `run_before_` controls the sequence:

```
run_before_01-prepare.sh        → System preparation
run_before_02-homebrew.sh       → Package manager setup
run_before_03-decrypt-age-key.sh → Secret decryption
run_before_04-requirements.sh   → System dependencies
run_before_05-system.sh         → System configuration
[Chezmoi applies dotfiles]      → Dotfiles deployed to home directory
```

## Template Structure

Each Before Script follows a common structure:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# @file Script Title
# @brief One-line description
# @description
#     Detailed multi-line description...

{{- if ne .host.distro.family "windows" -}}     # Skip on Windows
{{ includeTemplate "universal/profile" }}         # Load PATH and environment
{{ includeTemplate "universal/logg" }}            # Load logging functions

# Script logic here...
{{ end -}}
```

Key elements:
- **`{{ if ne .host.distro.family "windows" }}`** - Skips the script on Windows (PowerShell is used instead)
- **`{{ includeTemplate "universal/profile" }}`** - Sources PATH configuration from `home/.chezmoitemplates/universal/profile`
- **`{{ includeTemplate "universal/logg" }}`** - Sources the `gum log` logging wrapper
